# Surreality
A SurrealDB SDK, which provides schemas and strict types. The purpose was to bring a ORM that can work with tRPC effortlessly (almost).

## What works now
* **transactions** (basic). Need to fix return types
* **select** (basic) 90% ✅
* **create** (basic) ✅
* **merge** 100%?
* **relations** planned
* **relate** works.
